Good database for a good reading bookstore üëç
Built using PostgreSQL. To make your own instance of the database, simply copy the queries I provided. 
Made to be as normal as possible, inspired by the Sakila Database.

# API

API is also available to use. Built using Python and Flask, tested with curl (too lazy to use Postman, sorry). 

## Disclaimer

Yes this is a class project.
